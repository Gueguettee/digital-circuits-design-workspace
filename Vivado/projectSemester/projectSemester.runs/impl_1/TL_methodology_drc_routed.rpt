2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT comp3/Q_o_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[1].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[2].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[3].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[4].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[5].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[6].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[7].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin comp1/SIPO[8].memory_reg/Q_o_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-15#1 Warning
Large hold violation  
There is a large clock skew of 1.973 ns between comp3/FSM_sequential_current_state_s_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_o_Int_PLL) and comp2/PISO[2].PISO_reg/Q_o_reg/D (clocked by clk_o_Int_PLL) that results in large hold timing violation(s) of -1.455 ns. Fixing large hold violations during routing might impact setup slack and result in more difficult timing closure
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch comp3/enSIPO_s_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin comp3/enSIPO_s_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
