comp1/SIPO[1].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[2].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[3].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[4].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[5].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[6].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, comp1/SIPO[7].memory_reg/Q_o_reg, and comp1/SIPO[8].memory_reg/Q_o_reg
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT comp3/Q_o_i_2 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
